The nationalism of national liberation thus includes, for the minority of the national group involved, a paradox: a loyalty to the idea of the national group which is most intense, emotional and committed, to the point of sacrificing one's life, but which is also, on other criteria, quite shallow, apparently founded upon intellectually erroneous grounds.
