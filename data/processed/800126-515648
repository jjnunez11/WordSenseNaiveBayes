For many, having children does not have a money price because exchanging them for money, whether buying or selling, is inconsistent with a proper appreciation of the value of parenthood. 
In a way which calls for an explanation, both their rejection of the idea that having children has a price and their refusal even to contemplate such exchanges are part of their respect for parenthood, an expression of the very high value which they place on having children. 
Since the value of not exchanging children for money   from the value of having children it is misleading and distorting to say that of these two they value having children less.
