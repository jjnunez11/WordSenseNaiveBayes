The side-walls of the train concourse were devoted almost entirely to Reiss's murals &ellip. and the end wall was covered with a world map and clock dials showing the hour differences in various time zones. 
Elsewhere on the walls there was a trim of Red Verona and various domestic gray and black marbles; the low vault of the ceiling was again done in orange and yellow plaster, and the floor was finished in red and tan terrazzo. 
Wood veneer finishes with aluminum trim characterised the lounges and offices: zebra wood, holly, and walnut in the men's lounge were arranged in abstract designs   from railroad locomotives, cars, and signals; panels of zebra and madrone wood covered the women's lounge; and gum, harewood, and holly were used in the offices along with cork flooring.
