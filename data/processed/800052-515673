It was the weekend of the massive demonstration in observance of Human Rights Day, and the atmosphere inside the building (previously devoted to the use of the Soviet-Czechoslovakian Friendship Society and `probably bugged", I was loudly and cheerfully told) was at once relaxed, frantic, purposeful, and chaotic. 
`The relations between the people, the educational system, and culture are governed by the following principles: democracy; humaneness; love of truth; love of the homeland." 
I asked my Czech friends about `humaneness" and was told lidskost   from lidsky and lide (people).
