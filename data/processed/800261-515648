If collective goods such as membership in a society are intrinsically valuable, then it is to be expected that they provide the source both of personal goals and of obligations to others. 
The confrontational view of morality which pitches a person's own interests and goals as not only occasionally in conflict with his obligations to others but as deriving from independent and fundamentally different sources is essentially an individualistic conception. 
My objections to the view that morality is right-based   from a sense of the inadequacy of the conception of morality in the narrow sense which itself is a reflection of the rejection of moral individualism.
