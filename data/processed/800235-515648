The need to make films longer, in order to compete with American and French imports, also bred a more insidious form of dependence. 
For 15 years British filmmakers had experimented with the medium, developing film editing and camera effects to build suspense, and explore a world of magic and fantasy. 
Seen now, these early British films still have a feeling of freshness and spontaneity that   from the natural performances of non-actors, and a loose approach to framing which allows interesting material to get in at the edge of the picture.
