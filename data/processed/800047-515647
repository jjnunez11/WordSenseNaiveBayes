Most universities and polytechnics do not have sufficient resources to provide adequate facilities and support for disabled students, according to a Labour Party survey. 
Nearly all institutions believe extra help should come through further Government support, or a combination of such funding and students own disabled allowance. 
The survey findings out today were   from a questionnaire sent to all Universities and Polytechnics in the UK, which was answered by 64 per cent of universities and 76 per cent of polytechnics.
