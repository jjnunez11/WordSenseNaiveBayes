In ditches and damp springs, you may sometimes  notice that the water is discoloured to a strong shade of orange. 
This is caused  by `iron ochre", a generic term used to describe the iron-derived material which  blocks drains. 
Iron sulphides occur naturally in the form of mineral iron pyrites,    from rock slate or else found in peat and marine deposits.
