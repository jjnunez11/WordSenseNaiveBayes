Franklin Evans (John Pearson, New Malden) for the defendants; Christopher Makey (T W Lynch &and. Co) for the plaintiff. 
Mr Evans, relying on Stilk v Myrick (1809) 2 Camp 317, submitted that although the defendants might have   practical benefits from paying the bonus &dash. such as ensuring the plaintiff continued to work, avoiding the penalty for delay and the trouble and expense of engaging other carpenters &dash. they derived no benefit in law, since the plaintiff was promising to do no more than he was already bound to do.
