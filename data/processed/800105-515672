In other words I would suggest that the principle is derivable from a morality which regards personal autonomy as an essential ingredient of the good life, and regards the principle of autonomy, which imposes duties on people to secure for all the conditions of autonomy, as one of the most important moral principles. 
To   the harm principle from the principle of autonomy one has to establish that autonomy-based duties never justify coercion where there is no harm.
