Infra-red remote sensing of city-wide heat loss, promotion of car pooling, CFC extraction from scrapped fridges, phasing out the use of peat, reducing packaging, a commercial embargo of wildlife   products and a presumption against developments on sites of wildlife value are a few which give a flavour of a greener Leicester.
